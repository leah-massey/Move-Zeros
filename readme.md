# Move Zeros

This is a Codewars level 5kyu kata which I am solving using TDD

## The Challenge:git branch -M main

Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
